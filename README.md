End-to-End Banking EDA Project This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset. It covers the process from data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling categorical &amp; numerical variables to detailed visualization and statistical insights.
The analysis helps uncover customer behavior, income patterns, savings, credit card usage, and loyalty classification trends in the banking sector. Visualizations include bar charts, histograms, subplots, line graphs, and boxplots to provide a clear business understanding.
