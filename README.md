# Bankingcasestudy
End-to-End Banking EDA Project This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset. It covers the process from data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling categorical &amp; numerical variables to detailed visualization and statistical insights.
The analysis helps uncover customer behavior, income patterns, savings, credit card usage, and loyalty classification trends in the banking sector. Visualizations include bar charts, histograms, subplots, line graphs, and boxplots to provide a clear business understanding.
Banking EDA Case Study

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a Banking dataset. The analysis explores customer demographics, financial behaviors, and product usage to derive insights that can help banks improve decision-making and customer segmentation.

 
 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
Clean and preprocess raw banking data
Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
Visualize relationships using plots (bar charts, line graphs, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.)
Derive actionable business insights from customer behavior


Tech Stack

Python 

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning: Handling nulls, duplicates, and data types

Univariate Analysis: Distribution of Income, Savings, Credit Card Balance

Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between Income vs. Savings, Loans vs. Credit Cards

Correlation Heatmap: Detecting strong positive/negative correlations

Categorical Analysis: Value counts of Gender, Occupation, Risk Weighting



 Insights of EDA

The strongest positive correlation occurs among Bank Deposits, Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Foreign Currency Accounts, indicating that customers who maintain high balances in one account type often hold substantial funds across others.
Higher-income customers tend to own more credit cards and have higher savings.
Customers with multiple properties show a stronger link to higher risk weighting.
Spending behavior varies across occupations and loyalty classifications.



 Visualizations;

Some of the plots included:
Bar charts for categorical features
Line plots for Income vs. Savings trends
Subplots combining histograms + boxplots for numeric columns

Boxplots for numeric outlier detection

Heatmaps for correlation analysis
